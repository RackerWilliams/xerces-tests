* XSD Tests


The following tests are used to check edge cases that have bitten us
in the past in the Xerces XSD 1.1 implementation.

** Running tests

You'll need maven 3 to run the tests.  Simply type:

mvn test

You can run these tests against the Saxon EE implemntation, but this
will require a license.  To run against Saxon EE type:

mvn test -Dtest.xsd.impl=Saxon

I usually do:

mvn test -Dtest.xsd.impl=Saxon && mvn test


** How tests work

In the xsd_tests directory there will be a test directory named X

X/*.xsd   Contains the XSDs we are the XSD we are testing. All XSDs
          in the directory will be loaded.
X/good/*  Contains good instances that should pass validation
X/bad/*   Contains bad instances that should fail validation
